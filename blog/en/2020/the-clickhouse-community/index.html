In this article we would like to outline how the ClickHouse community arose, what it is today, and how you can get involved. There is a role for everyone, from end users to contributors to corporate friends. Our goal is to make the community welcoming to every person who wants to join.</p> <p>But first, let’s review a bit of history, starting with how ClickHouse first developed at <a href=https://yandex.com/company/ rel="external nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Yandex</a>.</p> <h2 id=origins-at-yandex>Origins at Yandex<a class=headerlink href=#origins-at-yandex title="Permanent link"> </a></h2> <p>ClickHouse began as a solution for web analytics in <a href=https://metrica.yandex.com/about? rel="external nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Yandex Metrica</a>. Metrica is a popular service for analyzing website traffic that is now #2 in the market behind Google Analytics. In 2008 <a href=https://github.com/alexey-milovidov rel="external nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Alexey Milovidov</a>, an engineer on the Metrica team, was looking for a database that could create reports on metrics like number of page views per day, unique visitors, and bounce rate, without aggregating the data in advance. The idea was to provide a wide range of metric data and let users ask any question about them.</p> <p>This is a classic problem for data warehouses. However, Alexey could not find one that met Yandex requirements, specifically large datasets, linear scaling, high efficiency, and compatibility with SQL tools. In a nutshell: like MySQL but for analytic applications. So Alexey wrote one. It started as a prototype to do GROUP BY operations.</p> <p>The prototype evolved into a full solution with a name, ClickHouse, short for “Clickstream Data Warehouse”. Alexey added additional features including SQL support and the MergeTree engine. The SQL dialect was superficially similar to MySQL, <a href=https://clickhouse.tech/blog/en/2016/evolution-of-data-structures-in-yandex-metrica/ target=_blank>which was also used in Metrica</a> but could not handle query workloads without complex pre-aggregation. By 2011 ClickHouse was in production for Metrica.</p> <p>Over the next 5 years Alexey and a growing team of developers extended ClickHouse to cover new use cases. By 2016 ClickHouse was a core Metrica backend service. It was also becoming entrenched as a data warehouse within Yandex, extending to use cases like service monitoring, network flow logs, and event management. ClickHouse had evolved from the original one-person project to business critical software with a full team of a dozen engineers led by Alexey.</p> <p>By 2016, ClickHouse had an 8 year history and was ready to become a major open source project. Here’s a timeline that tracks major developments as a time series.</p> <p><img class=img-fluid src=https://blog-images.clickhouse.tech/en/2020/the-clickhouse-community/clickhouse-community-history.png></p> <h2 id=clickhouse-goes-open-source>ClickHouse goes open source<a class=headerlink href=#clickhouse-goes-open-source title="Permanent link"> </a></h2> <p>Yandex open sourced ClickHouse under an Apache 2.0 license in 2016. There were numerous reasons for this step.</p> <ul> <li>Promote adoption within Yandex by making it easier for internal departments to get builds.</li> <li>Ensure that ClickHouse would continue to evolve by creating a community to nurture it.</li> <li>Motivate developers to contribute to and use ClickHouse due to the open source “cool” factor.</li> <li>Improve ClickHouse quality by making the code public. Nobody wants their name visible on bad code. ;-)</li> <li>Showcase Yandex innovation to a worldwide audience.</li> </ul> <p>Alexey and the development team moved ClickHouse code to a Github repo under the Yandex organization and began issuing community builds as well as accepting external contributions. They simultaneously began regular meetups to popularize ClickHouse and build a community around it. The result was a burst of adoption across multiple regions of the globe.</p> <p>ClickHouse quickly picked up steam in Eastern Europe. The first ClickHouse meetups started in 2016 and have grown to include 200 participants for in-person meetings and up to 400 for online meetings. ClickHouse is now widely used in start-ups in Russia as well as other Eastern European countries. Developers located in Eastern Europe continue to supply more contributions to ClickHouse than any other region.</p> <p>ClickHouse also started to gain recognition in the US and Western Europe. <a href=https://www.cloudflare.com/ rel="external nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>CloudFlare</a> published a widely read blog article about <a href=https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-analyzes-1m-dns-queries-per-second/ rel="external nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>their success using ClickHouse for DNS analytics</a>. Alexander Zaitsev successfully migrated an ad tech analytics system from a commercial DBMS to a ClickHouse cluster. This success prompted him to found <a href=https://altinity.com rel="external nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Altinity</a> in 2017 with help from friends at <a href=https://www.percona.com rel="external nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>Percona</a>. US meetups started in the same year. With support from Altinity these have grown to over 100 attendees for online meetings.</p> <p>ClickHouse also took off in China. The first meetup in China took place in 2018 and attracted enormous interest. In-person meetups included over 400 participants. Online meetings have reached up to 1000 online viewers.</p> <p>In 2019 a further step occurred as ClickHouse moved out from under the Yandex Github organization into a separate <a href=https://github.com/ClickHouse rel="external nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>ClickHouse organization</a>. The new organization includes ClickHouse server code plus core ecosystem projects like the cpp and ODBC drivers.</p> <p>ClickHouse community events shifted online following world-wide disruptions due to COVID-19, but growth in usage continued. One interesting development has been the increasing number of startups using ClickHouse as a backend. Many of these are listed on the <a href=https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/introduction/adopters/ target=_blank>ClickHouse Adopters</a> page. Also, additional prominent companies like eBay, Uber, and Flipcart went public in 2020 with stories of successful ClickHouse usage.</p> <h2 id=the-clickhouse-community-today>The ClickHouse community today<a class=headerlink href=#the-clickhouse-community-today title="Permanent link"> </a></h2> <p>As of 2020 the ClickHouse community includes developers and users from virtually every region of the globe. Yandex engineers continue to supply a majority of pull requests to ClickHouse itself. Altinity follows in second place with contributions to ClickHouse core and ecosystem projects. There is also substantial in-house development on ClickHouse (e.g. on private forks) within Chinese internet providers.</p> <p>The real success, however, has been the huge number of commits to ClickHouse core from people in outside organizations. The following list shows the main outside contributors:</p> <ul> <li>Azat Khuzhin</li> <li>Amos Bird</li> <li>Winter Zhang</li> <li>Denny Crane</li> <li>Danila Kutenin</li> <li>Hczhcz</li> <li>Marek Vavruša</li> <li>Guillaume Tassery</li> <li>Sundy Li</li> <li>Mikhail Shiryaev</li> <li>Nicolae Vartolomei</li> <li>Igor Hatarist</li> <li>Andrew Onyshchuk</li> <li>BohuTANG</li> <li>Yu Zhi Chang</li> <li>Kirill Shvakov</li> <li>Alexander Krasheninnikov</li> <li>Simon Podlipsky</li> <li>Silviu Caragea</li> <li>Flynn ucasFL</li> <li><a href=https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/graphs/contributors rel="external nofollow noreferrer" target=_blank>And over 550 more...</a></li> </ul> <p>ClickHouse ecosystem projects are also growing rapidly.
